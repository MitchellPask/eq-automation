# Equation Automation

### This repository contains source code for a tool that can recognize handwritten operators and operands and execute the appropriate mathematics to provide the user with the equation result.
#### Developed by Mitchell Pask with the use of open-source tools, frameworks, and examples.

#### The finished project will include a number of pieces required to have an easy to use tool

FEATURES & FRAMEWORKS:
- `GUI` - A Graphical User Interface framework like Tkinter will be used to facilitate ease of use.
- `CNN` - A Convolutional Neural Network will be utilized to recognize hand written digits.
- `Keras` - An open-source neural network library will be imported for use of it's MNIST digits classification dataset.
- `Tenserflow` - An open-source symbolic math library will be used to employ some machine learning concepts and methods.

FILES:
- `README.md` - Contains a brief overview of the projects goals and contents.

#### Please raise an issue if you have questions or encounter problems with the tool. Thank you!
